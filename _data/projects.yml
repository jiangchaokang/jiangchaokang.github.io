  # date: 2021-09 ~ 2023-03
  responsibilities:
    - A new data pre-processing method is proposed to achieve more efficient fusion of the different signal features. The indexes between different sensor signals are established in advance and stored in a map, while synchronized sampling provides fast and accurate query correspondence for feature fusion.
    - Multiple methods are explored to achieve cross-modal feature fusion more reasonably and efficiently, including soft query weights with perceiving the Euclidean distance of bimodal features, and fusion modules based on dual attention correlating the geometric features and texture features of the scene.
    - A bi-modality feature fusion module with both hard and soft components is proposed, which guides the network to refine more accurate 3D positions and orientations of objects in the second stage. The proposed method achieves advanced performance on the nuScenes dataset, especially demonstrating powerful performance for small object detection with degraded image quality and objects with few LiDAR signals.
  description: This is a preliminary research project aimed at exploring data-driven methods for image and LiDAR fusion. We focused on two 2D-3D fusion approaches to address the high latency and low accuracy of current 3D obstacle detection models. Our goal is to accelerate the practical application of these models.
